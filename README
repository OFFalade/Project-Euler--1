This was the first problem on the website www.ProjectEuler.com 

"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

The % is used to check whether a value is a multiple of 3 or 5 in a loop. If it is then it will add that found value to a sum variable and so on and so forth.
